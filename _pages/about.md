I am an associate professor of mathematics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. My research focuses on commutative algebra with a geometric and computational flavor. Please see the menu above for my publications.

I will speak at [Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry in Milan](https://www.caag26.polimi.it/) in 2026.

I will be a plenary speaker at the 2026 [MEGA - Effective Methods in Algebraic Geometry](https://maths.dur.ac.uk/mega2026) at Durham University, UK.

I am an editor for the [Journal of Commutative Algebra](https://rmmc.asu.edu/jca/jca.html). Please consider submitting your relevant work.

Undergraduate Activities
======

I mentor teams of students working in the [Polymath Jr.](https://geometrynyc.wixsite.com/polymathreu) large-scale undergraduate research program. An article about this program appeared in the Notices of the AMS [When life gives you lemons, make mathematicians](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202103/rnoti-p375.pdf).

I am the founder and director of the [Nebraska Experimental Mathematics and Outreach (NEMO) Lab](https://aseceleanu.github.io/NEMO) affiliated with the [Geometry Labs United](https://geometrylabs.net)  network.
