I am an associate professor of mathematics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. My research focuses on commutative algebra with a geometric and computational flavor.

I have been awarded the 2018 [Harold & Esther Edgerton Junior Faculty Award](https://executivevc.unl.edu/faculty/evaluation-recognition/awards/edgerton) for creative research, extraordinary teaching abilities, and academic promise.

 I have been awarded the 2024-2025 [Ruth I. Michler Memorial Prize of the AWM](https://awm-math.org/awards/ruth-i-michler-prize).
 
 I am giving a series of [lectures](https:aseceleanu.github.io/files/Lefschetz Preparatory School -- Notes by Seceleanu-final.pdf) in the [Lefschetz Preparatory School](https://lefschetz.uken.krakow.pl/school/) in Krakow.

I co-organize the workshop [Women in Commutative Algebra III](https://mathstat.dal.ca/~faridi/WICAIII) at CMO Oaxaca June 2-7, 2024.

I am an editor for the [Journal of Commutative Algebra](https://rmmc.asu.edu/jca/jca.html). Please consider submitting your relevant work.

Undergraduate Activities
======

I mentor teams of students working in the [Polymath Jr.](https://geometrynyc.wixsite.com/polymathreu) large-scale undergraduate research program. An article about this program appeared in the Notices of the AMS [When life gives you lemons, make mathematicians](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202103/rnoti-p375.pdf).

I am the founder and director of the [Nebraska Experimental Mathematics and Outreach (NEMO) Lab](https://aseceleanu.github.io/NEMO) affiliated with the [Geometry Labs United](https://geometrylabs.net)  network.

In co-organize the [Central States Mathematics Undergraduate Research Conference](https://math.unl.edu/events/cesmur) in partnership with colleagues at Kansas State University.
