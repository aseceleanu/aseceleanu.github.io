I am an associate professor of mathematics at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. My research focuses on commutative algebra with a geometric and computational flavor. Please see the menu above for my publications.

 I have been awarded the 2024-2025 [Ruth I. Michler Memorial Prize of the AWM](https://awm-math.org/awards/ruth-i-michler-prize).

I am an editor for the [Journal of Commutative Algebra](https://rmmc.asu.edu/jca/jca.html). Please consider submitting your relevant work.

My paper [Symbolic powers of codimension two Cohen-Macaulay ideals](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00935) won the 2024 [Earl J. Taft memorial award](https://www.tandfonline.com/journals/lagb20/collections/earl-j-taft-memorial-award).

Undergraduate Activities
======

I mentor teams of students working in the [Polymath Jr.](https://geometrynyc.wixsite.com/polymathreu) large-scale undergraduate research program. An article about this program appeared in the Notices of the AMS [When life gives you lemons, make mathematicians](https://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202103/rnoti-p375.pdf).

I am the founder and director of the [Nebraska Experimental Mathematics and Outreach (NEMO) Lab](https://aseceleanu.github.io/NEMO) affiliated with the [Geometry Labs United](https://geometrylabs.net)  network.
